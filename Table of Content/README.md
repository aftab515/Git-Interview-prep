### What Is Git and Why Is It Used?

Git is an open-distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their codebase and collaborate on projects with other developers. Git is typically used for software development, but it can be used for any type of file.

When a developer makes a change to a code file, they can commit that change to their local Git repository. Then, they can push their changes to a remote Git repository, such as a server hosted by a company or an open-source project. Other developers can then pull the changes down from the remote repository and incorporate them into their code.

And an important thing about Git is that it is a free source and open to anyone.
